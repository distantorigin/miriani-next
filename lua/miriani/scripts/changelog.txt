Version 4.0.beta.6:
* New: Replaced  the dialog-based configuration system with a new menu-based one. This menu behaves in the same manner as any menu on Miriani itself--it supports number-based selection, entering part of the name of a selection, or @abort to back out.
* New: Removed most of the volume categories from the settings available in F10. Now, volume is split among the following groups:
	- Master: Influences all volumes. Other volume groups are multiplied by this value.
	- Sounds: All sound effects throughout.
	- Environment: Ambiences, loops, potentially other things in the future.
* New: Added sound offsets for various categories. Currently these are hardcoded, although they could become configurable later:
	- Computer: -5% from default volume
	- Notifications: -15% from default volume
	- Combat: -5% from default volume
* New: Tracking system for starship contributions:
	- Tracks contributions received from players with name, amount, and frequency
	- CONTRIBS command displays sorted list of contributors (highest to lowest)
	- CONTRIBS CLEAR resets all contribution data
	- Plays sound when receiving contributions
	- Contributions buffer enabled by default to track all received contributions
* New: Sound for receiving credits from another player.
* New: You can now toggle various sound categories on and off from within the configuration menu. Keep in mind that this list populates as sounds play, so if a category you expect isn't there, try playing a sound that might be in the corresponding category first.
* New: Shift+escape now resets the info bar in addition to its existing functionality.
* New: Overhauled the configuration system to write to worlds/settings/toastush.conf rather than saving the configuration as a variable in MUSHclient's state. This will allow you to easily transfer configurations between clients or backup a known good config for later.
* New: Added optional, experimental formatting of scan output, which allows you to filter scans to be shown on a single line, similarly to the VIP Mud soundpack. Off by default, you can enable this under the ship category in config.
* New: Added 'sca' alias for atmospheric composition and 'scn' for natural resources on planets.
* New: Shift+escape resets scan state.
* New: Upgrade binary to MUSHclient 5.07-pre, based off of the tip of the current MUSHclient release tree (last updated in Aug 2025). Updater users will not receive this as part of the update process, and are encouraged but do not need to download the new executable from https://github.com/nickgammon/mushclient/releases, under the latest_commit (release) section.
* New: Added scan sounds from Miriani 7.
* New: Add background1 through background5.ogg, which get played when FTL and jumpgate jumps complete and the ship finishes launching. (Previously jumpgates played the move decelerate sound.)
* New: Add 29 new beep sounds.
* New: Add experimental code to the updater that will automatically reload any file that gets updated if the file is located under worlds\plugins. This will only work for updates moving forward after you've installed this version.
* New: Add baby sounds. (Credit goes to the Miriani Soundpack for VIP MUD. This is a direct migration and should operate the same.)
* New: Bias drive now has sounds.
* New: Added a sound for auction bids and add bids to an Auction history buffer. Sales will happen as soon as I have a sound.
* New: Add a sound for attempting to use a drive while it's still recharging.
* New: Add four new FTL and jumpgate sounds.
* Changed: No longer play a sound when in the middle of a wormhole. This was previously ship/move/flash.ogg.
* Changed: Enable a wider swath of history buffers by default.
* Changed: Standardized the grammar in the configuration menu labels.
* Changed: Update metafrequency to 7.07 instead of 0.07, for Toastush-NG users to report bugs.
* Changed: Lower asteroid rover ramp sounds by 25%.
* Changed: Anomaly detection sound reverted to older version from Miriani 7.
* Changed: The sound for being out of range has been reverted to the VIP Mud sound.
* Changed: Interrupt on scan coordinates now only works for starships.
* Changed: Remove "Launch complete." from spam reduction mode and replace it with the background sound and a random beep.
* Fixed: Info bar now resets in more places.
* Fixed: Ship locked on has been reverted to the classic sound. I accidentally wiped it out when merging classic in with main. Hurray regressions!
* Fixed: Set the minimum number of shots to 7 instead of 8 for the bardenium counter, which should, in theory, fix the double shot remaining on the ravager.
* Fixed: Fish warning in aquatic salvager now plays warning instead of scoop.
* Fixed: Using scan filter commands without arguments will now properly filter after choosing a target from the menu.
* Fixed: Scan filter commands are now case insensitive.
* Fixed: More say fixes, I'm not really sure anymore...
* Fixed: The Lore Computer print sound now works for any kind of paper.
* Removed: Interrupt on focus screen reader option.
* Removed: Computer voice files and the corresponding option.

Version 4.0.beta.5:
* New: Aquatic salvaging sounds for movement, scoop, fish encounters and probably more at the current time of writing.
* New: Enhanced Channel History plugin with quick buffer system:
  - Alt+Q: Cycle through favorited buffers endlessly
  - Alt+Shift+Q: Add/remove current buffer from favorited buffers/quick list
  - Quick list persists across client restarts
* New: Add planetary mining triggers. Credit for tunnel rats goes to the pull request here: https://github.com/PsudoDeSudo/Toastush/issues/5
* New: Add sound for drifting off to sleep (disconnecting while on the ground and/or furniture).
* New: Removed classic mode and merged all classic sounds with the Toastush default.
* New: Delete classic_miriani directory at startup.
* New: Added automatic detection and cleanup of conflicting sound files (removes non-numbered when numbered variants exist).
* New: Improved audio device switching with proactive health monitoring and automatic recovery.
* Fixed: Audio device switching now uses position-based detection to catch stuck playback and WASAPI output issues.
* Fixed: Fixed the say trigger to match on names with mixed capitalization beyond the first letter (i.e. Cedric McKinley)
* Fixed: Properly format says that are in all uppercase.
* Fixed: Don't play weapon firing sound for empty space when using the ravager's laser turret.
* Fixed: Don't play weapon firing if you only have a single laser turret (probably related to the above change).
* Fixed: OICIC <person> no longer gets caught by the shout trigger.
* Fixed: Force all sounds to stereo (again). This flag got removed in the audio system overhaul. Ahem.
* Changed: Updated poke/nudge triggers to play sound when it's you performing the social.

Version 4.0.beta.4:
* New: Rewrite computer announcement handling to exist in a single trigger, using a table for the various strings that should be matched.
* New: Shortened "Shots remaining" in the bardenium counter to just "Shots" and experimentally made it display before the firing announcement, rather than after.
* New: Added 10 more keyboard and announcement sounds.
* New: Added separate sounds for the computer reporting things. Previously this just used the announcement sound.
* New: Play the punch sound for sock/slug/hit.
* New: Add weapon power up/power down to classic Miriani sounds.
* New: Add new display sounds that get used by the records, ships, cargo, damage, arsenal, and status commands.
* New: New connect sound.
* New: Play collapse/yawn socials when somebody disconnects.
* New: Sanitation drone sounds.
* New: Use weapon soundpack hooks instead of matching on messages manually. This should hopefully make them much more reliable for any kind of weapon, regardless of its name.
* New: Added static sounds for communicators and metafrequencies.
* Changed: Shorten private comms to only say [Player Name] instead of [Private | Player Name].
* Changed: Poke/nudge socials will only trigger when you've been targeted.
* Fixed: Show "Person yells" instead of "Person yell" and add support for the shout/holler versions.
* Fixed: Don't trigger say on flirt.
* Fixed: Clear focus and scan from info bar on launch/land. Previously this only cleared upon FTL, and unreliably so.
* Fixed: Say history, OOC, and other channels will no longer trigger the speech routine.
* Fixed: Say trigger now gets caught when seen via camera or droid remote.
* Fixed: Malformed say messages appearing in the say buffer.
* Fixed: "Asks you" will now trigger the direct say sound.
* Fixed: Bardenium counter no longer announces twice.

Version 4.0.beta.3:
* New: Rewrite bardenium shot counter by dynamically dividing available bardenium by the number of cannons announced in the firing message. Bugs are sure to be afoot with this one.
* New: Added a debug mode to subject yourself to spammy debug messages and errors. Enable under 'toastush:config general'
* New: Organization name is now gathered dynamically to trigger properly on the channel name. To set your org name, type 'tr channels' and it'll be set for you automatically.
* Fixed: Org sound now plays for messages that don't contain text (i.e. comm socials).
* Fixed: Completely rewrote say triggers to be more robust; also fixes a scripting error.
* Changed: Canceled the experiment and reverted classic engine sounds to the V7 version

Version 4.0.beta.2:
* New: Enable gag flavor text by default.
* New: Enable Cannon shot counter by default.
* New: Enable archaeology digging tracker by default.
* New: Added cease digging sound
* New: Replace requesting clearance to land/launch in classic mode.
* New: Added message board sound triggers and imported missing message board sound files (NewPost1-7.ogg, UnreadPosts.ogg).
* New: Message board notifications now play random new post sounds (NewPost1-7.ogg) when receiving new messages.
* New: Urgent message board notifications now play UnreadPosts.ogg for multiple unread messages when logging in.
* New: Began work on a script to generate the manifest out of MUSHclient, which should make life a lot easier.
* Changed: Experimentally change relativity sounds in classic mode to V6.
* Fixed: Suppress unable to play audio messages, need to add a debug mode to reenable them.
* Fixed: Pickaxe now uses shovel sound and properly counts depth when tracking artifacts.

Version 4.0 (Initial Release):
* New: Rewritten audio system, featuring smarter muting, foreground sound support, dynamic category adding, and more.
* New: Foreground Sounds (fsounds), a mode that will force sounds to only play while the session is foregrounded. You can enable this by typing fsounds, through toastush:config, or by pressing ctrl+F9.
* New: Allow certain high priority sounds through fsounds mode. Currently these are private comms and direct says.
* New: Aaaannnnd...added a new sound for says that are targeted directly at you.
* New: Play the say sound for targeted says that aren't sent to you.
* New: Add targeted says to the say buffer, even if they aren't specifically at you.
* New: Plugins can now broadcast various messages to create, remove, or modify audio groups from within Toastush itself.
* New: Enabled automatic device switching for audio devices via Audio.CONST.config.device_default.
* New: Flight control messages now use soundpack hooks to properly clean message formatting. Flight announcements like "A flight monitor announces, Ship detected" are now cleaned to just show "Ship detected".
* New: Fixed classic_miriani sound randomization to properly handle numbered variants (laser1-laser30, etc).
* New: Improved sound file finding to prevent randomization on already-numbered files. This would often manifest in things like unable to play insect2.ogg messages.
* Changed: Changed plugin name to toastush_ng, bumped version to 4.0, and now register soundpack as Toastush-NG.
* Changed: (updater.xml) Update URL now points at Toastush-NG repository.
* Changed: Migrated alt+shift+A to ctrl+L. With auto device switching, this keystroke should largely be a thing of the past, however.
* Changed: Alt+F10 (toggle sound mute) is now F9.
* Changed: Settings variable renamed from "secret_settings" to "toastush_settings".
* Changed: Starship relay messages now consistently show as [shipname] format instead of [Starship | shipname].
* New: Volume adjusting now has a sound.
* New: Audio mute now has a sound.
* New: Printing files from a Lore computer now has a sound.
* New: Players connecting, disconnecting, or reconnecting in the room now has a sound.
* New: Audio Style preference, available under toastush:config general or by typing toastush:classic. The only two preferences are Modern or Classic. Classic captures many of the old sounds from the circa 2012 era and earlier, restoring things such as: channel sounds, starship engine sounds, the multitudes of laser sounds, cannon sounds, target lock and many Lore computer sounds.
* New: (output_functions.xml) Re-added the boundary sound when the start or end of history is reached.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Add support for buffer names containing numbers.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Enter: Open a URL in the current message if there is one, otherwise open world configuration.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Shift+1-0: Jump to first through tenth buffer.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Shift+` (grave accent, also works without shift): If you have text typed in the command window, try to jump to a buffer starting with that text. Press the command with an empty window to return to where you were before the last jump, effectively allowing you to flip between two buffers.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Backslash: If you have text typed in the command window, searches toward the bottom of the current buffer for that text. Add Shift to search toward the top of the buffer. If a match is found, focus jumps to that message.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Shift+Enter: Copy current buffer to a notepad.
* New: (channel_history.xml) Alt+Shift+T: Toggle timestamp announcements.
* New: Optimized audio cleanup routines, which should hopefully make sounds a little bit more snappy.
* New: Enhanced audio resource management with proper stream cleanup and memory optimization.
* New: Forced laser and cannon sounds to pan randomly.
* New: Added automatic ASCII character translation to prevent MOO server from dropping non-ASCII characters. Smart quotes, dashes, ellipsis, and non-breaking spaces are automatically converted to ASCII equivalents when sending commands.
* New: Enhanced direct say trigger to handle "says to you" syntax in addition to existing "[to you]" format.
* New: Added an option under 'toastush:config reader' to interrupt speech for scan coordinates. This will reintroduce the old functionality found in many soundpacks where scanning anything would be interrupted almost immediately to read the coordinates. A 100ms delay has been added, which should allow most speech systems to read part of the name of the item before jumping to the coordinates themselves. These values may be tweaked.
* New: Added an option under buffer config to separate metafrequency channels into a buffer for each frequency.
* New: Added a sound for successful soundpack registration.
* New: Escape to @abort (rather than clear input).
* New: Stop all sounds immediately with shift+escape.
* New: Added pulse emitter sounds (LoadEMPulse1-3.ogg, EmptyEmitter.ogg) for loading energy packs and empty pulse emitters.
* New: Added triggers for pulse emitter loading and emptying sounds.
* New: Added "There are no damaged components" sound.
* New: Enhanced direct say triggers to support "asks you", "exclaims to you", and complex formats like "hesitates briefly before saying to you".
* New: General communication channels now display as [General] instead of [General Communication] for cleaner output.
* New: Added focus coordinates and last scanned coordinates to the status bar. Focus coordinates show "Focus: x,y,z (Target Name)" and scan coordinates show "Scan: x,y,z" in the info bar (Alt+Shift+I).
* Fixed: Don't show Short-range Communication as "Short".
* Fixed: Clear focus from info bar when we see the ship is no longer in the sector.
* New: Added destination finder coordinates to the status bar. Shows "Dest: x,y,z" when using destination finder commands.
* New: Destination coordinates automatically clear from status bar when ship finishes jumping (wormhole/relativity) or landing.
* Fixed: Bardenium shot counter now works correctly in all weapon configurations.
* Fixed: Spellchecker now plays the prompt sound.
* Removed: Removed aliases 'smc' and 'sma' from starmap filters, as these are now commands inside the game.
* Removed: @paste alias
* Removed: worlds/plugins/ClientLock.xml
* Removed: worlds/plugins/Text_To_Speech.xml
* Removed: worlds/plugins/timer.xml
* Removed: worlds/plugins/Timestamps.xml
* Removed: worlds/plugins/gmcp_handler.xml
* Removed: worlds/plugins/local_edit.xml

Version 3.1.74


    * Added spooky Halloween morphing sound!
  * Fixed the cannon shot tracker so that it rounds up to the nearest integer. This should solve odd-numbered cannon rooms.
  Per usual, use the weapon command in any cannon room to set the shots.
  * Nonbinary socials will now have a 50% chance at playing from the binary genders.
  * Fixed starship relay buffer capturing only name.
  * Fixed stun/healing weapons firing at 100% volume.

  * Various RP-related sounds.
  * Fixed various triggers in misc dealing with general sounds that did not work after a change of directories.
